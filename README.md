# Word Trends in Reddit

The main goal of this project is to analyze word trends over eight years of reddit files. First, implementing a heap, the most common words of specific years are found. A heap is a tree based data structure that holds the elements priority based. In this case, these are the key value pairs with the highest values. Then using a binary tree the frequency of specific words is found across all eight years.

Results:
When finding the most common words for each year. The words were always the, to, a, I, and, of, you, it, that, is or in one case in. The frequencies ranged from 0.013 to 0.043 but the frequencies changed slightly based on the year. This makes sense because these are very basic connecting words or words frequently found in common regular speech. Since these words are the most common in speech it makes sense they would be here as well.

In this graph you can see the trends of the words throughout this year. The trends of this graph matches the graph in the instruction showing that the code works. The trend makes sense for words such as yahoo which become less frequently used, apple which gained major attention in the 2010s, and uber which started to gain attention more recently.

For my list of words I first did some research on what the most used reddit words were in the year 2008. From this graph you can see that there is no clear pattern to the words. This makes sense because words that are the most frequent in 2008 may have gained momentum frequency wise over the years and are then declining. Or they are still on the up. I wanted to see if the words trend down because they were among the most frequent in 2008. The graph gives no clear indication for announcements, music, or aww. Science is clearing trending downwards and videos and games upwards. This makes sense for videos and games as videos and digital gaming were more and more accessible and popular through the 2010s. I got this list of words from: https://www.followchain.org/most-popular-subreddits/
